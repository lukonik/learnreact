# LearnReact

LearnReact includes Articles about React written by Me (Luka Onikadze)

# Technologies

NextJs, TailwindCSS, Github Pages

# AI Involvement

The articles are written by me from top to bottom, It takes a really long time for me to write them ( hope it will change in the futute )

Nevertherless, English is not my primary language, so I will use AI as a final reviewer for my article, which will fix the grammar and polish the text, the promp looks like this:


```Review the article and only polish the grammar; don’t add anything on your own.```


# Feedback
if you like the articles, give it a star on github, it means a lot :)
